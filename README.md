Lightweight PHP framework

## Goals:

### 1. Fast and lightweight
If you throw away all unused abstractions you will have high-performance. However, we can't refuse all abstraction. But if a balance is maintained this could be achieved.
Also having less redundant stuff helps to save time in reading the code, when you only see things that are used.

### 2. Accumulate repository set of quality components for common needs
With growth of community we could make them better and more of them.
They will be free and available to anyone.

### 3. Architecture to always keep potention for customisations
Ready stuff can really save time for development.
But it is bad when you can't use ready solution, because of it doesn't suit all required needs.

So, what if any customisation should not be hindered?
The idea is not to make huge and universal components with many of options for all occasions.
But make simple things that can be used in major cases. And then build on top of them to suit particular requirements.

### 4. One step towards a "Tool of tomorrow development"
