Lightweight PHP framework

## Goals:

### 1. Fast and lightweight
If you throw away all unused abstractions you will have high-performance. However, we can't refuse all abstraction. But if a balance is maintained this could be achieved.  
Also having less redundant stuff helps to save time in reading the code, when you only see things that are used.

### 2. Accumulate a repository of reusable, quality and reliable components
With growth of community we wiil have more componnets amd make them better.   
They will be free and available to anyone.

### 3. Always keep potential for customisations (via architecture)
Reusable solutions can really save time for development.  
But sometimes you can't use them, because it's hard to adapt them for your particular situation or they will bring unwanted behaviors or constraints.

So, what if any opportunity of customisation will not be denied?  
The idea is not to make huge and universal components with many of options for all occasions.  
But make simple solutions that can be used in major cases. And then build new variations on top of them to suit your particular requirements in the project.

### 4. One step towards a "Tool of tomorrow development"
